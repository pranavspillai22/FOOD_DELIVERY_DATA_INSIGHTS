**FOOD_DELIVERY_DATA_INSIGHTS**

In this project, I utilized SQL to explore and interpret a food delivery dataset, aiming to extract meaningful insights that support strategic decision-making. The analysis targets common challenges faced by marketing and growth teams, with a focus on understanding how users interact with the platform, what drives engagement, and how promotional campaigns influence customer behavior.

**SCENARIO**

Noon launched Food in Dubai on 1st of January 2025 and your line manager has asked you to share key performance metrics to gauge the performance of the verticals. All the data of orders is being inserted into the table we create using SQL queries. Resolve the following questions using sql for business analysis.

Q1. Find the top outlet by cuisine type without using limit and top function

Q2. Find the daily new customer count from the launch date (everyday how many new customers are we acquiring)

Q3. Find count of all the users who were acquired in Jan 2025 and only placed one order in Jan and didnot place any other order

Q4. List all the customers with no order in the last 7 days but were acquired one month ago with their first order on promo

Q5.Growth team is planning to create a trigger that will target customers after their every third order with a personalized communication and they asked to create a query for this.

Q6.List the customers who placed more than 1 order and all their orders on a promo only.

Q7.What percent of customers were organically acquired in Jan 2025(placed their first order without promocode)
